# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I'm most proud of my understanding of the terminal. Being able to read the feedback faster and adjusting my code. Just a couple weeks ago the terminal was a bit confusing to navigate. Much easier now!
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods are great ways to manipulate codes. There are so many different methods that can be iterated on a code. Methods can be great ways to check certain aspects without having to write more code or look through endless lines!
